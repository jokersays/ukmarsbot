# UKMARSBOT Contributor Guide
## Purpose
This document provides guidance for making contributions to the UKMARSBOT project. The UKMARSBOT is being developed in several stages, this guide will be updated as the project progresses. The focus of each update will be to guide contributors on making contributions to the current project stage.
The plan for the development of UKMARSBOT can be seen [here](UKMARSBOT-Project-Plan.pdf)

This issue of the Contributor Guide relates to the first stage of the project - creating the initial Revision 1 trial boards for low volume testing.
## Tools for Contributing
Suggested improvements, ideas and comments will be submitted and discussed using the __Issues__ function in the GitHub Repository (Repo).

As the project proceeds more of the functions provided by GitHub (creating forks and pull requests) will become relevant as artefacts such as code, pcb designs and other hardware items become available.

At this stage of the project the tool for consultation and general collaboration will be the __Issues__ capability of GitHub.
## Contributing to Revision 1 of UKMARSBOT
The focus of the Revision 1 phase of the project is to get a limited number of boards manufactured and supporting materials to enable trial and testing to take place on a project in a school commencing in the Autumn term 2019.

To this end a small group of UKMARS members have worked together to create initial items. Ideas and suggestions for improvements are always welcomed through raising an __Issue__. Given the timing constraints the project is retaining a strong focus on Revision 1 and is seeking specific focussed feedback and suggestions in defined time windows:
- Requirements
- Board design

Please refer to the project plan for when these focussed feedback periods occur.
Ideas and suggestions are not limited to these feedback periods, but in the short term the project will be prioritising the relevant suggestions in these periods.

When contributing through raising an __Issue__ please include:
1. Identification of the phase of the project to which the issue relates i.e. Revision1, Revision2 or After Revision 2
1. Identification of the artefact(s) affected eg Requirements, BOM, Board Design...
1. A clear and brief description of the suggested improvement

Thanks for your ideas and help.

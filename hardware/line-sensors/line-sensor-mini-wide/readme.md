# UKMARSBOT Line Sensors

Line sensors are intended to be used by robots built to run in the line-follower based events including classic line follower, half-size line follower and drag race.

## Line Sensor Mini Wide

The mini wide line sensor is designed to operate with the slots in the latest version (V1.3) of the mainboard.

__It will not work with earlier versions__

The connector should be a SIL socket that can push directly onto the sensor pin header on the motherboard.

There are four line detectors with three illuminating LEDs. These are much closer to the wheels than is normal but the idea is to make it easier to detect a wider range of line deviation. THis should make faster turns possible.

The marker sensors look through slots just in front of the wheels. There is no ideal position for these sensors that can positively detect the markers under all forseeable circumstance. Their current position is the best available compromise using the basic UKMARSBOT chassis.

# UKMARSBOT Wall Sensors

Wall sensors are intended to be used by robots built to run in micromouse maze-based events such as the wall-follower and maze solving classes.

## Basic Wall Sensors (20190815A)

The basic wall sensor board is a simple starter option for robots running in maze-based events. It has three pairs of emitters and detectors. One pair points directly forwards to measure the distance to a wall ahead if there is one. Two side sensors allow the robot to steer accurately in the maze and detect the presence of absence of a wall to either side. Both sensors will need to be used when following the IET figure eight maze course. For simple left- or right-wall following one or other side sensor can be omitted.

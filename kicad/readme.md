This directory holds version 1.3 of UKMARSBOT project files.

__Note that this is an untested version at present__

Once samples have been tested, Gerbers will be available for anyone to download sets of boards.

Members of the UK Micromouse and Robotics Society (UKMARS) are entitled to a complimentary set of boards upon joining as a perk of membership.

The files have been produced using KiCad 6.0 rather than Eagle. 

KiCad is completely free, has no restrictions on board sizes and will run on any operating system without the need for an internet connection or an account with a third party.

Models and footprints mostly from KiCad source libraries.

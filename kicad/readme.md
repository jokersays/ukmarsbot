# UKMARSBOT V1.3

This directory holds version 1.3 of UKMARSBOT project files.

Once samples have been tested, Gerbers will be available for anyone to download sets of boards.

Members of the UK Micromouse and Robotics Society (UKMARS) are entitled to a complimentary set of boards upon joining as a perk of membership.

The files have been produced using KiCad 6.0 rather than Eagle. 

KiCad is completely free, has no restrictions on board sizes and will run on any operating system without the need for an internet connection or an account with a third party.

Models and footprints are mostly from the KiCad source libraries. 

Contributions have also come from Mark Stillman, SnapEDA and GrabCAD.

This folder holds the Eagle design files for UKMARSBOT.

The files have been edited using Eagle 7.6.0.

Each subfolder has the Eagle files and a PDF schematic from the appropriate component in the project.

Also present is the single library file used for all the components, a copy of the Sparkfun DRU used to validate the layout and a modified Seeed studios CAM file that was used to generate the gerbers.

Zipped archives of the gerbers that were sent for manufacture are also included.

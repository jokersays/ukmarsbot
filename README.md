__A simple beginner's multi purpose robot platform__

Using inexpensive, readily available materials, components and techniques, UKMARS will be creating a basic robot design that can be used in a variety of common contests such as line following, wall following, drag race and mini-sumo.

Processor power will be provided by the Arduino Nano board becaue it is very cheap and widely available. There is a huge range of sample code available for almost any purpose and support is easily found online. The arduino software can be installed on any computer and is free.

### Coding
The Arduino is programmed normallly in C++. Code is written in a simplified IDE and the programs written there are generally called skethces. They consist usually of a single file, a 'sketch', made up of a number of functions and associated variables. The arduino IDE takes care of turningthe sketch into a complete program and uploading it to the Arduino board. For the great majority of users this is the best choice. However, if you need to use other languages, there are choices to suit you. (__None of these have beed tried by UKMARS__)

* FlashForth http://flashforth.com/ is a Forth stamp system implemented on the Microchip 8-bit PIC18F and 16-bit PIC24, 30, 33 and the Atmel Atmega microcontroller families. See also https://playground.arduino.cc/CommonTopics/ForthOnArduino/ for other options relating to Forth.

* For Basic users there appear to be fewer options. One of these is Great Cow basic http://gcbasic.sourceforge.net/Typesetter/index.php/Home. _"The  Great Cow BASIC suite is robust and fully functional compiler and assembler.   Using Great Cow BASIC is the fastest method to program a Microchip PIC or Atmel AVR 8-bit microcontroller for those just starting and the professional user."_  The host software is cross platform and there is a graphical editor as well as a more traditional IDE.

### Hardware

The robot hardware is constrained by the various contest events to be within certain dimensional limits. That means that the basic chassis will be smaller than 100mm x 100mm although add-on sensors for individual events will increase the size. Because the robot is meant to be multipurpose. there is a core hardware setup that provides for basic wheelchair drive of two motors, encoder feedback for indivdual motor speed and a minimal interface for user interaction. Components will be modular so that substitutions are easy and to provide the greatest flexibility. Builders are free to make whatever modifications suit their purpose. For example, larger or smaller motors may be used or tracked drive may be substituted for wheeled drive. 

### Power Supply

For most purposes, the power supply for the robot will need to be compact, readily available and easy to recharge. non rechargeable batteries are not economically viable for robot experiment and are, in any case, less environmentally friendly. Safety is a concern and so Lithium Polymer cells are only recommended when part of a regulated and protected pack. Perhaps the most common small battery is the rechargeable PP3 sized pack running at 8.4 Volts or 9 Volts. Rechargeable cells and their chargers can be purchased at supermarkets and online suppliers. More confident, or adventurous builders may install whatever power supply suits them.

### Motors

While there is endless variety in small DC electric motors, the N20-based gearmotors are excellent value for money and can be purchased in a huge range of performance characteristics. An example can be found here: [Pimoroni 20:1 gearmotor](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/micro-metal-gearmotor-extended-back-shaft?variant=32587847050). The common dimensions make it easy to swap motors without changing the mechanical design of the robot. Versions are available with built-in encoders allowing for more accurate control of speed and greater precision in movement of the robot. Normally these would be used in any robot. The drivers for these motors are available of small circuit board modules that can easily be connected with the Arduino Nano. 

### Materials

It is likely that many builders will have some access to a 3D printer or a laser cutter or both. Part designs will take into account both these tools. In case they are not available, it will also be possible to build the robot from other materials such as plain or pre-perforated PCB material. Access to basic hand tools and soldering equipment will be necessary though.

### Software

Pre-written software examples will be available as well as any special libraries that might be necessary. The intention is to provide all the basic building block that will allow someone to cnstruct a working robot that can be modified to run in a particular contest. There may be complete, working contest code examples but they will be intended to illustrate how things work and are very unlikely to be a direct short-cut to making a contest-winning robot. Instead, they will be designed as a starting point for higher performance entries.

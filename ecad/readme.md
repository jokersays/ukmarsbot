# ECAD project files

This contains the design files for the various electronic modules that make up the robot. The original development was done with Eagle Version 7 since it was the last 'free' version of Eagle. More recent versions are likely to be developed in KiCad since it is free, open source, unconstrained and multiplatform. 

You are only likely to need to look in here if you want to modify existing modules or create your own. Either Eagle or KiCad can be used for new development.

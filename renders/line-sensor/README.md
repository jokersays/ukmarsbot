## Note ##

The schematics and board layouts currently in this directory are for illustration, and do not necessarily form part of the documentation.

When the boards are released, the full Eagle files will be made available in the repository.

Meanwhile, these files are presented for discussion and should not be regarded as definitive.

## Line sensors ##

The line sensor board will attach to the front of the robot with the emitters and detectors mounted underneath, pointing at the floor.

The two line detectors straddle the edges of the line and point directly downwards.

The turn and finish markers are placed at the outer edges of the board and will be angled slightly outwards. The board width has been constrained to 100mm so that it fits the limits of the popular low cost board manufacturers.

A single transistor is available to turn on and off the emitters if that is desired. Alternatively, the transistor can be omitted and a wire link substituted so that the emitters are always on.

Two indicator LEDs are also available for user feedback.

The emitter and indicator output pin assignments correspond with those on the wall sensor board.

In use the line sensor board will overhang the front of the robot and extend to either side. Builders may find that the steering control of the mouse in this configuration will be different to that in the maze sensor configuration.

The 3D renders and photographs currently in this directory are for illustration, and do not necessarily form part of the documentation.

Specifically, the 3D renders (ukmarsbot-v45-_n_.png) show a 'battery box' which is not essential. The photograph ukmarsbot-battery-retainer-suggestion.png shows a battery retainer using 'off the shelf parts' (paper clips and rubber bands).

Much of the documentation is yet to be written. Hence the 3D renders are here because it is an easier way to illustrate UKMARSBot than trying to describe something which has no physical reality.

There will be a builder's guide that will go into the wiki. That guide would likely contain photos where appropriate.

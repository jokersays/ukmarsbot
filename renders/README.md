The 3D renders and photographs currently in this directory are for illustration, and do not necessarily form part of the documentation.

Specifically, the 3D renders (ukmarsbot-v45-_n_.png) show a 'battery box' which is not essential. The photograph ukmarsbot-battery-retainer-suggestion.png shows a battery retainer using 'off the shelf parts' (paper clips and rubber bands).

Much of the documentation is yet to be written. Hence the 3D renders are here because it is an easier way to illustrate UKMARSBot than trying to describe something which has no physical reality.

Not also that the perfboard models do not represent the appearance of the finished robot. That said, everything has been planned on a 0.1" grid so that intrepid builders are able to construct a robot using perfboard without having to obtain a PCB.

There will be a builder's guide that will go into the wiki. That guide would likely contain photos where appropriate.
